<p id="The-Wild-Child" class="margin">I have recently finished book 9 of the wild child series called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WILD-CHILD-Book-Life-Changing-ebook/dp/B08SGFHKV9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=wild+child+book+9&qid=1612688305&sr=8-1">Life's changing</a><br>
Its the last book of the series of Wild child. The whole series was filled with drama and friendship.<br>
Its amazing to see how sydney and harper become good friends from being enemies. Its full of adventure<br>
and its very interesting. The only thing I did not like was that Harper's very wrong actions were<br>
gone unpunished in book 6. Other than that, the whole series was awesome. I also liked how the author<br>
showed everything from different points of view. This series also had great character developement.<br>
It is a must read for all.<p>

    <p>              <br></p>
<p id="The-question-of-blood-of-olympus" class="margin">
Why was there no POV of Percy Jackson? This was because Percy had like an entire seies on him and percy<br>
was the only character which appeared in almost all books of Rick Riodan. He was taking the stage.<br>
Rick Riodan realized that. He replaced Percy with Jason. Many fans of Percy did not like this, but think about it-<br> 
Jason didn't have a book at all in which he was the main character. And Percy has 5. This is the reason Jason replaced<br>
Percy.
